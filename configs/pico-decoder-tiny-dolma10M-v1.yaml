# H100-optimized training strategy for fast, memory-safe training:
# 1. Conservative batch size (16) with scaled learning rate (0.0002) for stable H100 utilization
# 2. Reduced gradient accumulation (1 step) for faster optimization cycles
# 3. Shorter warmup (2000 steps) for quicker convergence with larger batches
# 4. Reduced evaluation frequency (1000 steps) to minimize training interruptions
# 5. Reduced checkpoint/logging frequency to minimize I/O overhead
# 6. Same model architecture and regularization for identical final performance
# 7. Expected 4-6x training speedup while maintaining model quality and memory safety
# 8. Memory usage: ~15-25GB of 80GB H100 VRAM (safe utilization avoiding OOM)
# 9. Maintains all stability features: RMSNorm, QK-Norm, dropout, weight decay
# 10. Same convergence quality with significant speedup and no memory issues
